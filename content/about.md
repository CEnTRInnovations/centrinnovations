**Hi, I'm Jeremy Price.** I'm the founder of CEnTRInnovations, and I believe in the power of merging smart technology with deep, community-driven insights. My mission is to empower communities and organizations to make informed decisions that lead to real, positive change.

I am a passionate innovator, researcher, and technologist dedicated to building solutions that are not just effective, but also ethical and equitable. I work at the intersection of technology and human-centered design, creating tools that are rooted in collaboration and purpose.
